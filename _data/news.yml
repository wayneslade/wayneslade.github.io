  headline: [Faculty Spotlight: Wayne Slade, Ph.D.](https://www.fau.edu/research/research-daily/2024/new-faculty-wayne-slade/)
  content: FAU Research Communications published a new faculty spotlight on Dr. Slade's background and ocean optics research interests. 
  “I’m really excited to dig into more applied research,” Slade said. “One of the things that motivated me coming back out of the private 
  sector, where I was working predominantly on the engineering problems of building sensors, was to take the technology and actually 
  get boots on the ground – or in the water – to measure, gain understanding, and solve problems.”

  headline: Dr. Slade receives FY25 grant for *Developing a Facility for Measuring Hyperspectral Scattering Properties*.
  content: This project aims to develop a lab facility for measuring hyperspectral scattering properties of field samples and algal cultures.
  The specific research objective in this initial work is to acquire the components to build the measurement setup and develop the calibration
  and data processing methods. Even with the increasing shift towards hyperspectral ocean color remote sensing, there is limited work on 
  measuring hyperspectral scattering properties of ocean particles. Consequently, expanding HBOI's capabilities in hyperspectral measurements 
  is timely, offering visibility and collaboration opportunities.
  Using this facility, the initial hypothesis to be tested is whether the hyperspectral scattering properties of key blooming harmful algae 
  species are significantly different than the properties of non-bloom algal conditions. This hypothesis will be examined both with in situ 
  samples of non-bloom and blooming waters, as well as available algal cultures.
